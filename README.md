# Image Slide Animation Gallery

This project is a simple image gallery that features a **hover-based slide animation effect**. When a user hovers over any image in the gallery, that image expands smoothly to provide a better view.

## 💻 Features

- Smooth CSS transitions
- Responsive layout using Flexbox
- Clean and minimal design
- Hover animation effect on images

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure of the gallery
- `style.css` – Styling and animation for the gallery
- Image files: `1.png`, `2.png`, `3.png`, `4.png`, `5.png`

## 🔧 How It Works

- The gallery uses a flex container to display images in a row.
- Each image starts small and expands when hovered.
- Transitions are handled smoothly using `transition` in CSS.

## 🎨 Preview

When you open the HTML file in your browser, you'll see five images side-by-side. Hover over any image to see it smoothly grow in size.

## 📷 Screenshot

## 📌 Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure you have the image files (`1.png` to `5.png`) in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
